	<h1> HTML is Structure Only </h1>	
	<p>Well first of all, so what does HTML stand for? Well it stands for, Hyper Text Markup Language. So let's go over each one of these words and find out what exactly they mean. So first of all, hypertext. Well hypertext is text which contains links to other texts and that's basically the entire web, right? One document points to another document which points to a bunch of other documents and it grows on and on and on. Sometimes they link back to the original document and it becomes one gigantic web and obviously it's not just about text nowadays, hypermedia is plays a huge role in the web today. You can watch videos, listen to music and really hypermedia is just an extension of hypertext.</p>
